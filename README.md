# Anomaly-Detection-in-Credit-Card-Transactions-using-Power-BI
About:-
Anomaly detection in credit card transactions refers to the process of identifying unusual or fraudulent activities in credit card transactions. It involves applying statistical, machine learning and Power BI techniques to detect patterns and deviations from normal behaviour, helping to identify potential fraudulent transactions in real-time.

Project Overview:
The objective of this project is to develop a Power BI dashboard for anomaly detection in credit card transactions. Anomaly detection is crucial for detecting fraudulent activities and ensuring the security of credit card transactions. By leveraging Power BI's data visualisation and analytical capabilities, this project has been created for an interactive dashboard that provides insights into transaction patterns and identifies potential anomalies.
